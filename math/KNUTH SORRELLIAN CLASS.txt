KNUTH-SORRELLIAN-CLASS Mathematical System
Class 1
Class 1 introduces the foundation of the KNUTH-SORRELLIN-CLASS. It consists of three variables:
- A: Base
- B: Power (Base to the power of B)
- C: Iteration count (how many times the entire problem is repeated)
This class expands on traditional Knuth up-arrow notation by embedding iteration at a fundamental level.
Class 2
Class 2 is a 3-rotational recursive system:
Rotation 1: 
- New Base = Solution from Class 1
- New Power = Previous Base
- New Iteration = Previous Power

Rotation 2 and 3 follow the same logic, recursively nesting each result. This increases computational complexity exponentially with each rotation.
Class 3
Class 3 adds a fourth variable – the number of Class 2 rotations (must be a multiple of 3).
Each 'rotation group' simulates a higher-level iteration of Class 2 logic.
This further escalates the scale, exponentially compounding the already expansive Class 2.
Class 4
Class 4 introduces mirroring through recursion and entropy.
- Two simultaneous calculations: one recursive, one entropic.
- These operate in mirrored, opposing directions.
- The results are then 'folded' together using a compression-expansion logic analogous to folding a paper so tightly it bursts outward.
This generates the Class 4 solution – a duality of collapse and expansion in numerical form.
Class 5
Class 5 loops through all previous classes using mirrored computations:
- Begins with Class 4's solution.
- Recursively mirrors backward: Class 4 → Class 3 → Class 2 → Class 1.
- Each reversed calculation is performed.
- All mirrored states are folded together.
- Final folding of recursive and entropic components yields the Class 5 solution.
This class represents a meta-synthesis of all prior levels, forming a closed recursive-entropic mathematical ecosystem.
