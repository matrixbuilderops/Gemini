Consensus mechanism
Dynamic tempalte manger- should be notified that there is a soltuion form teh producion miner, once that happens it should compar ethe soltuion against the tempalte file to make sure it is valid if yes. then it makes the ldgers/math proof or updtes and also makes the submission file

looping - it has a vonssensus mecahnsi that it verifies tha tthe submisson is acatully a good soltuion based off oteh tempalte fiel and makes sure that teh dyamci tempatel magner did its job, then it checks in with the brain.

brain- does a consensuson the whole system makes sure teh sytem reprots are madke adn correct, erro reprots  same thign, allof the aggerated and aggerd idnex, ledgers, math proof, submission logs, global aggerated & index
after evertying is godo teh looping file should be notified

the looping file makes its submisson log file or updates an exsiting one and submis the submssion file to the bitoicn node

brain run an addiontal consesu making sure tha tthe sumbsion lgos and the glboal ggerated and glboal aggeatde inex are good aftewards
